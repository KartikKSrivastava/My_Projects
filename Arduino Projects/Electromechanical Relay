A relay is classified into many types, a standard and generally used relay is
made up of electromagnets which in general used as a switch. Dictionary says that relay means the act of
passing something from one thing to another, the same meaning can be applied to this device because the
signal received from one side of the device controls the switching operation on the other side. So relay is
a switch which controls (open and close) circuits electromechanically. The main operation of this device
is to make or break contact with the help of a signal without any human involvement in order to switch it
ON or OFF. It is mainly used to control a high powered circuit using a low power signal. Generally a DC
signal is used to control circuit which is driven by high voltage like controlling AC home appliances with
DC signals from microcontrollers.

Functions Used from Arduino Library:

1. digitalWrite(pin_number,state):
Action: puts a pin on high or low as state of the pin.
Return Type: void
2. delay (milliseconds):
Action: pauses the execution of the program for specified time
Return Type: void
3. Serial.begin(baudRate):
Action: initiate the serial connection
Return Type: void
4. Serial.println(text_String):
Action: print the text string on next line of serial console
Return Type: void
5. Serial.print(text_String):
Action: print the text string on serial console
Return Type: void
6. pinMode(pinNumber, STATE): where STATE is HIGH or LOW
Action: set the pin behaviour as input or output
Return Type: void
