The Capacitive touch sensors are very popular since they are more robust, durable and user friendly.
Moreover, it is also cost-effective when compared resistive touch sensors. In Capacitive touch sensor there
are the two parallel plates which form a capacitor with some capacitance value. In the application of a sensor
the capacitance is measured continuously with the help of capacitance measurement circuit.
As we touch the sensor through our finger, our finger acts like a conductive object and hence produces a
capacitance value.
There will be uncertain increase in the capacitance if any conductive object such as our finger touches the
plate. The capacitance measuring circuit will detect the change in the capacitance and will convert it into a
signal.

Arduino Program

#define touchpin 4 // sets the capactitive touch sensor @pin 4
int ledPin = 2; // sets the LED @pin 2
void setup() {
 pinMode(touchpin, INPUT); //sets the touch sensor as input
 pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT); //sets the led as output
}
void loop() {
 if ((digitalRead(touchpin)) == HIGH){ //if sensor is HIGH
 digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); //LED will turn ON
 }
 else{ //otherwise
 digitalWrite(ledPin,LOW); //LED is turned OFF
 }
 delay(300); //delay of 300milliseconds
}
